# Internship Dashboard – Automated SaaS KPI Pipeline

This project was developed during my internship at **Kombo AI**.  
It automates the collection, transformation, and visualization of SaaS business metrics.  

Due to the use of company data, this repository only includes **non-sensitive components** of the project.  
Where data or code is omitted, descriptions and examples are provided to illustrate the work done.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Build a reliable data pipeline and dashboard to support strategic decision-making.  
- **Approach:** Designed an automated ETL process in Python, producing cleaned datasets that feed into a Power BI dashboard.  

---

## 🔑 Showcased in this Repo
- Project **folder structure** and code skeletons.  
- Example ETL scripts (with mock endpoints and dummy data).  
- **Metrics pipeline logic** (functions for MRR, ARR, CAC, EBITDA, etc.).  
- **Dashboard screenshots** using synthetic demo data.  
- Documentation of workflow, tools, and design choices.  

---

## 🔒 Excluded for Sensitivity
- Real company datasets (ChartMogul & Holded extracts).  
- API keys, configs, and authentication details.  
- Actual business metrics and financial outputs.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- **Python** (pandas, requests, pyarrow)  
- **APIs** (ChartMogul, Holded)  
- **Power BI** (DAX, data modeling, dashboards)  
- **GitHub Actions** (ETL workflow automation)  

---

## 📊 Example Outputs
*(Screenshots or mock dashboards with synthetic data can be added here.)*

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Production-quality ETL scripting (logging, error handling, modular design).  
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions.  
- SaaS financial metrics modeling.  
- Translating complex data into actionable dashboards.
